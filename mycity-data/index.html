			New York City is investing in making public benefits accessible. The bad news is that the Office of Technology & Innovation has overspent by nearly $9 million to do so. </p>

<p>
29 vendors have helped to build the MyCity website, <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/content/getstuffdone/pages/mycity-portal">which</a> “aims to cut through the red tape and reduce government bureaucracy, allowing easy access for 24/7 on-the-go New Yorkers to apply for and access city services and benefits.” </p>

<p>
So far, New Yorkers can access a simplified application to apply to childcare, a link to a news jobs portal, and a chatbot that will tell you lies about running a <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/03/29/ai-chat-false-information-small-business/">small business.</a> </p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.checkbooknyc.com/smart_search/citywide?search_term=mycity*!*domain%3Dcontracts&page=0">Data </a> from the city’s comptroller office acquired by the NYCity News Service <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dbr686-i16j851ewQVr8nTLy4NvZy95A-BuTmrbeKJc/edit?usp=sharing">shows </a> that those contractors who received the both the largest and most number of contracts have overspent most egregiously. For example, Rangram Consulting who received nine separate contracts spent nearly double the original allocated funding, mostly on professional services. </p>

			The MyCity project aligns with a <a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/press/releases/2024/07/dinapoli-nyc-contract-spending-rises-7-billion-fy-2019">larger trend</a> of outsourcing work through private contracting outlined by the state comptroller. While simply overspending itself shouldn’t raise too many alarms, responsible technology advocates like Kate Brennan, the Associate Director at the AINow Institute, say that New York has a responsibility to use its in-house city unionized workers to build the site. 
				</p>

<p>
“Instead of using this as an opportunity to develop the pipeline of New Yorkers who will gain the skills to work on these technical issues, you're basically depleting a talent pool of public workers long term,” Brennan told the NYCity News Service. 
	</p>

<p>
As outlined in <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/publication/ai-nows-testimony-to-new-york-city-council-on-corporate-capture-of-the-mycity-portal">Brennan</a> and other’s testimony to the New York City Council Committee on Technology this fall, skeptics are also raising alarm about potential privacy concerns. The City’s Chief Technology Officer Matthew Fraser projected that MyCity could eventually be used as a digital wallet, allowing New Yorkers to receive their benefits through the site and allowing government agencies to track how New Yorkers are spending their money. “This raises massive privacy concerns. Where is all of this data going? You're contracting with a private company who's suddenly going to have access to New York City's most intimate personal details, there's a real question about how or why that is necessary for the delivery of benefits.”
